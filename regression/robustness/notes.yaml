 The dependent variable is the log monthly earning of the worker in the given year.
 All specifications control for occupation and year fixed effects, 
 indicators for gender and schooling and a quadratic function of worker age,
 quadratic functions of log firm employment and firm age.
 In column 4, we also control for, but do not report, quartiles of total (as opposed to occupation-specific) import per worker.
 Standard errors, clustered by firm, are reported in parantheses.
 Coefficients significantly different from zero at 1, 5 and 10 percent are marked by ***, ** and *, respectively.
