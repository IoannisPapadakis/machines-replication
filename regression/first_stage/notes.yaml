 The dependent variable is an indicator for importer status.
 All regressions estimated by ordinary least squares and control for occupation-year fixed effects.
 Worker controls include indicators for gender and schooling and a quadratic function of worker age.
 Firm controls include quadratic functions of log employment and firm age.
 Observations are weighted by $1/n_{fot}$, the inverse of the number of workers in a firm-occupation-year cell.
 Standard errors, clustered by firm, are reported in parantheses.
 Coefficients significantly different from zero at 1, 5 and 10 percent are marked by ***, ** and *, respectively.
